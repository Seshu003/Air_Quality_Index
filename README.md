# 🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques.  
It analyzes historical air quality data and forecasts AQI levels based on **pollutant concentrations** like:  
✅ **PM2.5**  
✅ **PM10**  
✅ **NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO**  
✅ **Temperature & Humidity**
