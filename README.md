#Air Quality Index Prediction
#📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The model is trained on historical air quality data and can forecast AQI levels based on pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO, temperature, and humidity.

#⚡ Features
✔️ Real-time AQI prediction based on pollutant levels.
✔️ Historical data analysis to identify pollution trends.
✔️ LSTM-based time series forecasting for accurate predictions.
✔️ Data preprocessing with missing value handling & scaling.
✔️ Visualization tools to analyze AQI trends.

#🛠 Tech Stack
🔹 Python – Core programming language
🔹 TensorFlow/Keras – LSTM model training
🔹 Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing
🔹 Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
🔹 Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
